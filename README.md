**tasklist** is a tool for minimal to do list management.

It supports a workflow for dealing with tactical tasks that need to be done
today, similar to [The Taste of the Day][totd], or a very stripped down version
of [Getting Things Done][gtd] or The Cycle System from [Time Management for 
System Administrators][tmsa].
